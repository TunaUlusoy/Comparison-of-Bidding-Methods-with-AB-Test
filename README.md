# Comparison-of-Bidding-Methods-with-AB-Test

## Business Problem
Facebook recently introduced a new type of bid, average bidding, as an alternative to the current type of bidding called maximum bidding. A company has decided to test this new feature and wants to run an A/B test to see if average bidding converts more than maximum bidding. The success criterion of the company is Purchase. Therefore, it is necessary to focus on the Purchase metric for statistical tests.

## Dataset Definition
This dataset, which includes the website information of this company, includes information such as the number of advertisements that users see and click, as well as earnings information from here. There are two separate data sets, the control and test groups. These datasets are in separate sheets of the "ab_testing.xlsx" excel. Maximum bidding was applied to the control group and average bidding was applied to the test group.

* **Impression**: Ad views
* **Click**: Number of clicks on the displayed ad
* **Purchase**: Number of products purchased after ads clicked
* **Earning**: Earnings after purchased products
